This projet was made on solo and represents the first skecth of a possible and inexistant franchise Ramen Restaurant;
The projet was made between september 5th and 9th , mostly at Becode! 

The restaurant's name is inspired by one real tiny and cozy Japanese Ramen's restaurant at the heart of Brussels. Yamato means battleship. 

This web site consists in 5 main pages : Homepage, restaurant's menu, pictures, adresses and contact. It was mainly build on Bootstrap. 

A quoi ça ressemble ? La progression… Qu’est-ce que ça contient ? Comment qu’on l’installe ? D’où ça vient ?
